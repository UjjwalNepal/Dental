          Composite veneers is a technique used to improve the appearance of your teeth. The term "composite"
          refers to a tooth-colored blend of materials, either plastic or resin, which is bonded to an existing
          tooth surface. Such kind of veneers are done in one appointment.{'\n'}{'\n'}
          Bonding is basically a process where in enamel-like dental composite material is applied to tooth's surface,
          sculpted into desired shape, hardened with a high intensity light and then polished. Bonding is ideal for
          fixing minor chipped or cracked teeth, hiding discoloration on the tooth's surface, or reducing the gaps between
           teeth.{'\n'}{'\n'}
          They are also being used as a cavity filling material due to cosmetic reasons.
           bonding creates more esthetically pleasing teeth and a brighter smile. Unlike veneers or crowns,
           composite bonding requires very little removal of the original tooth.{'\n'}{'\n'}

          Advantage of ceramic veneer over composite bonding/composite veneer:{'\n'}
          1. Durability: Ceramic veneers are more durable. Inspite of being very thin, once bonded to tooth structure    it becomes very strong and is difficult to remove. Porcelain veneers can last for longer span of time.{'\n'}
          2. Aesthetics: Ceramic veneers give a much more natural tooth like appearance due to the translucent    properties of porcelain that mimic the light handling properties of enamel.{'\n'}
          3. Gum tissue tolerance.{'\n'}
          4. Stain resistant.

              Tooth Contouring and Reshaping
          </Text>

          For individuals who have chipped, cracked or irregularly shaped teeth, dental contouring and reshaping
           can be just the ticket for a more beautiful smile.{'\n'}{'\n'}
          Tooth reshaping, or contouring, is one of few instant treatments now available in cosmetic dentistry.
          Dental reshaping and contouring is a procedure to correct crooked teeth, chipped teeth, cracked teeth
          or even overlapping teeth in just one session.{'\n'}{'\n'}
          Braces under certain circumstances. It is a procedure of. A few millimeters of reduction and a few
          millimeters of tooth-colored laminate can create a beautiful smile when performed by a cosmetic dentist,
           with no discomfort to you. Tooth reshaping, or dental contouring, is commonly used to alter the length,
            shape or position of your teeth.{'\n'}{'\n'}
          The reshaping of your teeth is a procedure that involves the removal of a very small amount of tooth
           structure to help achieve a more desirable smile. Chipped or fractured areas are smoothed out and
           specific angles or edges can be rounded or squared. Contouring creates better alignment and can create
           a more feminine or masculine smile. It is sometimes done to prevent chipped areas from getting worse.
           Tooth reshaping is a safe and conservative way to improve your smile. Since teeth can become weaker if
           large amount of enamel is removed, this procedure is limited to minor changes or combined with veneers
           or bonding for a terrific smile.
